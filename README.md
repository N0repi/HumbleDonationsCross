I am open-sourcing this project. I originally built Humble Donations with the goal to help others gain alternative sources of capital and traction- so, it only seems right to open-source this repo.

# Introduction

Humble Donations is a decentralized application which enables users to send and receive cryptocurrency donations in full.

The platform provides everyone with the ability to receive alternative, transparent forms of revenue through a simple user interface.

Humble Donations is the first platform to write webpages directly to the blockchain. A unique protocol when ensures ownership of dynamically written webpages.

## Goal

**What's better than a crowdfunding website that takes 10% of donated contributions?**

**A website that that takes 0%.**

**We simply want to the raise the bar to a higher standard.**

We want to contribute to a better, more ethical online experience by providing a donation-based application without revenue cuts, subscription fees, data collection, ads, and censorship.

We want an ecosystem for users, by users. Humble Donations is a reliable, innovative web application without compromise.

## Web application
- [Humble Donations](https://www.humbledonations.com/)
- [Docs](https://docs.humbledonations.com/Introduction)


## Chain Support
The application is deployed on Sepolia, Arbitrum One, and Sonic. The platform is cross-chain compatible.

## Wallet Support
- The application supports account abstracted without gas sponsorship
- Custom configuration for EOA wallets such as MetaMask, CoinBase Wallet, WalletConnect, and more.

## Humble Donations Token (HDT)
HDT uses a liquity pool on UniswapV3 for Arbitrum One and Sepolia, while the liquidity pool for Sonic is held on Equalizer.

The protocol contracts leverage DEX's for "auto-swaps" to maintain stable liquidity for HDT.
